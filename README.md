# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide used to note what I've learned in my coding bootcamp prework. My motivation behind this was to get hands on experience with the tools and workflow behund creating a site. I built this project to give me a clear space for note-taking, organization of the topics I've learned, and the first actions towards learning to code. This solves the problem of having jumbled, inconsistent, or confusing notes. I learned the beginning stages of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

To use this study guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on where to start, you can open the DevTools (command+option+I) or (control+shift+I). There will be a console panel listing the topics covered and a suggestion of which to study first.
